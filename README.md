User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines



Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title



Changes Made:-

Added some Semantic elements to increase accessibility and elements follow a logical structure.
Added some alt attributes to images so that if images cannot displyed then this tag shows an alternate text.
Added comments on both html and css file to organize sections.
Both html and css files follows a logical structure.
